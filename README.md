# Naturally_Evolving_Sounds_From_Life

Naturally evolving sounds from Life creates music based on Conway's Game of Life.

The music can be manipulated using the Xbox Kinect as an alternate interface to a mouse and keyboard.

The code cannot run without the Kinect SDK V1.6 installed, however will run without a Kinect conencted.

If you do not have access to a Kinect the ScreenShots folder contains screenshots of the software running with a Kinect connected.
